## Key Questions Explored with SQL

### 1. What is the average screen time by age group?
### 2. Compare average screen time between genders on weekdays vs weekends.
### 3. Which age group has the highest recreational screen time on weekends?
### 4. How much more screen time do kids get on weekends compared to weekdays by type (educational vs recreational)?
### 5. Do boys or girls spend more time on screens for educational purposes?

## Insights (To Be Explored Further)
- Weekend recreational screen time is significantly higher.
- There may be noticeable differences in screen usage by gender.
- Younger vs older kids show different patterns in how they use screens.
- As a person keeps getting old, they tend to spend more time on screens.
- This is great for companies as they could market their products and services.
